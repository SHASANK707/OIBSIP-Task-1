# OIBSIP_Task2
This code generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) for the player to guess. The player is prompted to enter their guess, and the game will tell them if their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, at which point they are congratulated and the game ends.
